## Space Mama’s Crater

### Stage 1

- The first cage can be found on the pathway to a second exit sign. As you advance to the rightmost part of the stage, you’ll see some moving pencil sharpener platforms above you which will lead you to a platform above. Climb the pencil sharpeners to find a platform on the upper right, then go left and follow the path of slippery black erasers until you reach a pink flying ring. The first cage will be to the left of the flying ring, blocked by three spiky yin-yang balls, which you’ll have to clear in order to break the cage.

- After you drop down, you’ll see a gap with an arrow of Tings pointing downwards. Jump over that gap and go left where you’ll climb a series of pink flying rings. The second cage can be found to the left of the second exit sign. Make sure you jump over the sign as it will appear in front of you.

### Stage 2

- The third cage can be found if you go down a gap with a red flying ring. The cage can then be seen next to a colorful paint can with 2 hunters.

- The fourth cage can be seen initially before the third cage, though you can’t reach it until you pass the area with the bouncy erasers. When you get to the two symmetrical slopes, run down the right one and then jump with momentum as you run back up the left slope; you will reach a platform above. Proceed left along this platform until you reach the cage.

- You can meet the Magician in this stage. First you must travel until you reach the first photographer; then, as you proceed right, you will see 2 vanishing clouds. Fall on the path below and then continue travelling to the right until you see a pit to the abyss below. This is where you have to use the running/helicopter ability to reach the other side, where the Magician is waiting. In this bonus level you must collect 16 Tings in 50 seconds. The main gimmick in this level is the presence of bouncy erasers. Compared to other bonus levels, this one is a bit more forgiving with the time.

### Stage 3

- Proceed through the stage until you get to the the second photographer. Jump off the left side of the platorm and board the pencil sharpener, where you must quickly alternate between ducking under the drawing pins while clearing the yin-yangs. You’ll reach another platform, then you’ll need to board another pencil sharpener platform to your right. As the sharpener starts moving, you’ll need to jump over a drawing pin and land the sharpener again. As you approach an arrow of Tings, you should hear a chime. Return to the platform on your left, where you’ll need to use a pink flying ring to reach a bouncing cloud, then board the pencil sharpener platform. You’ll see more bouncing clouds to your right; these will lead you to a platform above, where a pyramid of Tings sits. Collect them and the fifth cage will appear on your left, though you’ll need to drop down to the pencil sharpener platform and use the vanishing cloud on your left to reach it.

- Advance all the way to the end of the stage, then board the pink platform above the exit sign. A chime will be heard; you will then need to go back to the left and jump on the pencil sharpener platform. As it takes you to the left, board the two pencil sharpeners that suddenly appeared to reach the platform above, then crawl through the opening to grab a pink flying ring. After swinging on it, another pink flying ring appears. Use it to reach the platform above where the sixth cage is, along with lots of Tings.

### Stage 4

> **Note:** This stage can only be visited once.

- In this stage, you’ll fight **Space Mama** for a second time. Duck when her washing machine first appears. When she comes out, you will have a chance to hit her on the head, but only when she is shooting a laser from her rolling pin. After you hit her enough times, she will then also begin attacking you with waves of pots, so make sure to avoid those. At some point, when her health is low enough, she will hide behind her washing machine and fire lasers continuously and you won’t be able to directly hit her. You have to alternate between jumping and ducking under the lasers while continuously hitting the washing machine until it bounces off (you know you’re getting closer the more it vibrates), at which point you can then continue hitting her. You have to hit Space Mama 12 times to defeat her.
