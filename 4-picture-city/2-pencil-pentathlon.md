## Pencil Pentathlon

### Stage 1

- As you begin this stage, jump on top of the ink jar to your left. You should hear a chime and a pencil sharpener will appear to your right. Jump on top of it, but quickly follow it by jumping over the erasers as it starts moving to the right. Bounce on the pink pens and proceed further right. Either climb above or go below the platform to the right of the pens. If you went above just drop down to the right. You’ll then climb up on the platform to your left and see the first cage. The trick is to stand really close to the fountain pen, jump and punch through the gap, then duck, so that your telescopic fist will hit the cage while retracting.

- Go back to the left and climb up to proceed further into the stage. You’ll see another split path with the choice to go above where there’s a hunter or drop onto a cloud. Go the lower route and you’ll see the second cage to your right. When the cloud bounces down, just walk or crawl right onto the platform, then back to your left again to get under the cloud. As soon as you fall make sure to hold right as otherwise you may fall down the gap, plummeting to your death. You’ll drop onto an elf which will shrink you. You’ll then be able to jump up through the small space to your right and then break the second cage. Your best bet is to jump up into the space on the right and then jump higher to the left where another elf will appear. You can then crawl right under the pencils where the photographer is. Proceed to the end of the stage.

### Stage 2

- In this stage, you’ll get the **Super Helicopter** power at the beginning. Fly through the stage while carefully avoiding the spikes, thumbtacks and pencil points. When you come to three vertically moving pencils pointing downwards, pass them, then fly to the platform above to your left, which is above the pencils. Fly over the pencils (crawl when above them to avoid being squashed if your timing was off) and you’ll find the third cage on this platform just left of them. Beware of the hunter who appears when proceeding right if you picked up the health boost.

- Proceed further into the stage and be careful at the tricky part with all the bouncing spikes. You’ll have to punch them all to clear the way then crawl through the space. As you eventually get by all these potential hazards, approach the exit sign but do not touch it. Just as you’re beside the sign you’ll hear a chime, go back to the right and on the platform just under the exit sign, you’ll find the fourth cage. Just fly very close to the thumbtack and punch from there and you’ll break the cage. Complete the stage.

### Stage 3

- The fifth cage is just at the bottom of all the bouncy erasers. It’s a bit tricky to get to; just follow the path of the Tings to it using the hanging and helicopter abilities to avoid contact with the erasers. When you get to the bottom where the Tings lead, break the fifth cage which will be on your left.

- You’ll then have to follow a second ting path; otherwise, you’ll end up on a higher path with Tings spelling out “NO”, indicating you went the wrong way. You’ll get to a photographer after you go in the right direction and, as you pass him, literally hold right (but don’t run). You will bounce across through all the hazards and you’ll land on a vanishing cloud. Quickly jump to the next ones and proceed right to avoid getting hurt. Proceed right to the rightmost point you can reach. You’ll then see a sharpener appear, but don’t jump on it; just go under it. You’ll land on a sharpener below which brings you left, then jump from that to another that moves upwards. You’ll jump on pencils then to your left then using the running and hover abilities navigate further left across more pencils. Eventually you’ll land on a fourth set of pencils where the sixth cage will appear along with 2 pairs of shooting eyes. Break the cage then proceed right and complete the stage.
