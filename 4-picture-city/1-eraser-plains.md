# Picture City

## Eraser Plains

### Stage 1

- Take the upper path to the dead end. When you get to the last area, fall towards the left and the first cage will appear at the end of the path.

- Go all the way to the end of the stage. When you see 8 yin-yang balls, grab the ledge to the left, then get on the platform that appears to the ledge above. The second cage will appear on the other side, so you must backtrack to that area.

### Stage 2

- When you get to the second wave of pencils, jump above them and collect the Tings until you hear a chime; then use the flying blue elf to shrink and go through the small passage. The third cage will be at the end.

### Stage 3

- The fourth cage is in plain sight; however, it can’t be accessed unless you shrink. Travel to the area where lots of spiky yin-yang balls and clear all the balls out to make platforms appear. Ride the topmost one all the way to the end where a flying blue elf awaits you. With this, you can reach the cage.

- The fifth cage is also in sight, however a yin-yang ball must be knocked over to safely access the cage. Ride the platform to the right to reach the ball to be hit.
Continue down the path until you reach a bunch of Tings resembling a smiley face. Run down the slope and jump as soon as you see a trail of Tings which leads to a large health boost. Jump towards the Tings to the left and the cage will appear on the platform near the smiley face.
You can meet the Magician in this stage. Proceed through the stage until you come to a path blocked by numerous spiky yin-yang balls. Clear them to free up the path and proceed right, where you’ll find him. In this bonus stage you must collect 15 Tings in 35 seconds. No real gimmicks, but it’s highly recommended that you use the running ability here in order to collect all the Tings in time.

### Stage 4

> **Note:** This stage can only be visited once.

- No cages are in this stage; however, you must fight **Space Mama** and her two lackeys in this stage. You *must* defeat her two lackeys in order for her to appear. Take care of the ring throwing pirate first, it attacks by throwing its ring at you like a boomerang. Be mindful that the bomb pirate will also be throwing bombs at you while you do this. After defeating him, you will also need to defeat the bomb pirate. Continuously hit the pink crow’s nest until he comes down, then hit him repeatedly. Once both lackeys have been defeated, Space Mama herself will come out. In this instance, she mainly attacks by throwing knives at you. Use the knives that stick to the stage to bounce up and hit her face. You must hit her 6 times to defeat her.
