## Mr. Dark’s Dare

> **Note:** This stage can only be played once; any subsequent visit will just load the credits.

### Stage 1

- For the duration of this stage, you will be sliding down hills of whipped cream on a frying pan, so you will only be able to jump. Be careful not to fall in any pits or lemonade pools.

### Stage 2 

- As soon as you reach this stage, **Mr. Dark** will appear and cast a spell that creates your wicked double, **Bad Rayman**! He’ll copy every move you make. You’ll need to avoid contact with him at all costs, as contact with him will result in an instant death. Be careful to plan your route as you proceed to the exit.

### Stage 3 

- In this stage, **Mr. Dark** will cast various spells on you, which can hinder your progress throughout the stage.

  - **Spell 1:** This spell will be cast upon entering the level. It reverses your horizontal movement so that left is right and vice versa. This spell will wear off when you reach the photographer. 
  
  - **Spell 2:** This spell will be cast right after you pass the photographer. It causes you to run continuously forward. You won’t be able to stop or use your helicopter at this time, so be very careful where you jump. This spell will wear off right before you reach the exit sign.
  
  - **Spell 3:** This spell will be cast on you as soon as the second spell wears off. It takes away your telescopic fist so you can’t punch. Unlike the other two spells, this spell will not wear off.

### Stage 4

- You will finally face the final boss, **Mr. Dark**, in this stage. He will initially taunt you with the telescopic fist he stole from you, after which he will proceed to attack you with fire balls. At some point, he will trap you between two pillars of flame. Eventually, after dodging all the attacks, he will then try closing them in on you. Don’t panic though, as the Electoons will come and return your telescopic fist − you will then need to fight three transformations. 

  - **Transformation 1:** This transformation consists of Mr. Stone’s body with Mr. Skops’ head and claw. He only attacks with his claw, but if you punch too early, he will block his face with the claw, so wait until after he attacks. You’ll need to hit him eight times to defeat him.

  - **Transformation 2:** This transformation consists of Space Mama on Bzzit’s body, and there are two of them. They will be shooting lasers from either left or right, so avoid the lasers and hit them. It’s possible to hit either of them or even have them shoot each other. You’ll need to hit them eight times to defeat them.

  - **Transformation 3:** This transformation is a combination of Space Mama’s body, Mr. Sax’s feet and hands, and Bzzit’s head, and you are also shrunken down for this fight. The only attack is from him jumping about and attempting to stomp you, so the running ability will be useful here. The impact from the jump will launch you high into the air, allowing you to hit his head, the only weak spot. You’ll need to hit him eight times to defeat him.

After you defeat all three transformations, Mr. Dark will flee the Candy Château and will not be seen again. Afterwards, Rayman, his friends, and most of the game’s bosses will honour themselves with by going on vacation. Congratulations, you’ve just finished the game! Enjoy the credits; hopefully you’ve had fun playing!!
