# Blue Mountains

## Mr. Stone’s Peaks

### Stage 1

- In the beginning of this stage, you’ll break a rock which contains the Musician’s guitar. He then gives Rayman a Super Helicopter, allowing him to fly when you repeatedly tap the <img align="center" alt="PlayStation cross button" src="../images/PlayStation_button_X.svg"/> button. Proceed right avoiding the spikes until you see the photographer. There’s 2 spiky balls to the right and a gap, fall down here and walk left to find the first cage.

- Fly back up and proceed right until you see another photographer. Proceed further right until you see the second set of spiky balls with the health boost between them. Fall down this gap and walk right to find the second cage; then fly back up and proceed right to complete the stage.

### Stage 2

- In this stage, you’ll be trapped in a chasm with a giant slate being pulled down by 2 rocks tied to it with ropes. You’ll need to use the super helicopter to fly into the weaker sections of these ropes to cut them, while also avoiding the spikes. After you cut them, the water below will drain and you’ll see the exit sign to the right. Fly up above the sign instead where you’ll see the third cage. Break it then go back down to the exit.

### Stage 3

- Walk to the right and jump on the cloud. You’ll then have to quickly climb up some clouds and ledges as the water level rises. When you get to the above platform where the water stops rising, proceed left and jump on the cloud. Proceed by jumping on the appearing clouds and follow their path, where you’ll find the fourth cage on the upper left ledge. Proceed back to the right along the clouds, where you face the same water rising scenario again. Afterwards, proceed right to complete the stage.

### Stage 4

- Navigate your way through this stage until you get to the photographer. After you pass him, proceed right; then jump off the edge while hugging the wall to the left. You’ll land on a platform below, containing the fifth cage to your left.

- Climb back up along the clouds to get back to the upper level, then proceed right, passing all the lava balls by using the hanging ability on the ledges. You’ll eventually come to a few swinging spiky balls. Punch the first one and proceed past it. Punch the second one and fall down the gap below it, where you’ll find the sixth cage (avoid the 3 stone dogs which appear). Climb back up and proceed right to complete the stage.

- You can meet the Magician in this stage. When you first start, continue travelling until you reach a slippery slope with several Antitoons trying to snap at you. Reach the end of the slope, then go in the first pit you see (it will have a vanishing cloud). The Magician is hiding there. In this bonus level, you must collect 13 Tings in 20 seconds. The main gimmick here is bouncing clouds. You don’t climb in this bonus level, but time is much shorter here than in other levels, so be quick!
