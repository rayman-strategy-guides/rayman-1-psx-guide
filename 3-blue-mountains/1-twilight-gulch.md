# Blue Mountains

## Twilight Gulch

> **Note:** You can’t progress through this stage unless you get the grappling fist ability. Go to **Moskito’s Nest** if you haven’t done so already. You can also only get five cages on your first visit.

### Stage 1

- Jump over the beginning exit sign to the left and fall down the gap. Keep to the right while falling and you’ll land on a platform below. Advance further and crawl under the spikes while avoiding the Lava Rocks that the stone man will throw at you. Quickly proceed forward, throw a few charged hits at him to knock him down then proceed to the rightmost point. Jump and try to grab the ledge to the left. The first cage will appear on the ground just to the right of your position. Watch out for the stone dog that appears beside it!

- After you get the first cage, jump on the cloud and up to the ledge then proceed left. You’ll walk under the third cage (you’ll get to this later), keep walking left and you’ll see yet another cage. Jump up and break this second cage.

- Walk left, fall down and then go jump on the cloud to your left. Jump back over the exit sign again as the cloud rises back up and proceed to the right. You’ll see some Tings; ignore them for now and fall down where you will see and break the third cage that you had just walked under when breaking the second cage.

  > **Note:** Proceeding past this point in the stage will require the grappling fist ability.

- Go back to those Tings and then jump, hover and punch following the path of Tings to grapple a flying ring. Swing by both rings and you’ll see a stone man. Swing and jump over him as he’ll be right on the edge. Proceed right and defeat another stone man then fall down the gap where you’ll find the fourth cage. Avoid the hunter’s fire then walk left to collect the health boost. Clouds will appear which lead you back to the surface.

- *(this cage requires the running ability)*  
  This one is a bit tricky to time right. You’ll see Tings pointing to a flying ring just to the upper right. You’ll have to run, jump, and then punch at the perfect time for Rayman to grab a hold of the flying ring. Once you get it, jump up onto the surface and walk to the right. The fifth cage will appear along with 2 stone dogs.

- Jump back down, proceed right and defeat the stone man and then jump down the gap. Make sure to keep left while falling where you’ll land on a cloud. This cloud will only appear if you keep left otherwise it won’t and Rayman will fall to his death. This cloud will bring you to the right where you’ll break the sixth cage. Be sure to face right and charge Rayman’s fist.
  - Alternatively, you can fall off the gap on the left instead, where the ting trail leads, then jump for the ting to the right, where the cloud appears under it.

### Stage 2

> **Note:** This stage cannot be revisited once the player defeats Mr. Stone.

- There are no cages ion this stage; however, you’ll have to avoid **Mr. Stone** as he chases you. This can be a bit tricky due to how you have to fall into a channel filled with lava rocks to avoid the spikes. You then have to break them while avoiding the projectiles and walk right where more will appear behind you along with a cloud above the spikes. You’ll have to break all the lava rocks again, then hang on the edge of the spikes to avoid getting hurt and jump to the cloud.

- As you’re being chased by Mr. Stone the second time, you will see 3 rocks in your path. The third one hides a 1-up.
