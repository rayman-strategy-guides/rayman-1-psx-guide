# Blue Mountains

## The Hard Rocks

### Stage 1

- As you begin this stage, crawl under the rocks to the left and jump on the cloud, then keep jumping on the vanishing clouds while being sure to dodge the lava rock to get to the top. Hit the spiky ball blocking your way, drop down and jump to get the health boost in front of you, making sure to avoid the two picks. Drop down the two clouds and go between the spiky balls while avoiding the pick that appears. Hop over the middle ball to spawn a 1-up, which you can grab by jumping and hitting it with your fist. 
- Walk right and fall down the gap while keeping right to land on a lower ledge. Proceed further right while avoiding the spiky balls and you will see the first cage being guarded by a hunter.
- When you reach the end of this stage, you can go left instead of touching the exit sign and jump on a cloud which appears. It will take you to some flying rings which lead to a second exit where you can get another 1-up.

### Stage 2

- Proceed to the right, avoiding the spiky ball which moves horizontally. Fall off the edge to your right, landing on the ledge below and collect the health boost. After collecting it, you should hear a chime and a vertically moving cloud should have appeared above the spiky ball. Use the two clouds to reach a platform above which you’ll see to your left. Crawl through the space and move quickly to avoid being hit by appearing Antitoons. The second cage can be found to the very left.
- Go back to the right, fall back down and proceed to the right. You’ll see some vertically moving clouds inclining upwards towards the right. Climb up and jump to the furthest right highest cloud and then turn left. You’ll see a ledge you can hang on, climb up and crawl to the left to get the third cage.
- Proceed to complete the stage while carefully avoiding the appearing lava rocks, hunters and the pick in the crawl space near the end along with the hunter guarding the exit sign.
- You can meet the Magician in this stage. After passing a series of vertically moving clouds where you got the third cage, hug the wall to the right of the rightmost cloud. As you fall down, you’ll see a crawl space with a path of Tings ending in a diamond, where you’ll find the Magician. For this bonus round, you must collect 15 Tings in 45 seconds. The gimmick here is that there are vanishing clouds, so you must move quickly.

### Stage 3

- Proceed to the right and make your way up the hill while avoiding obstacles. You’ll see a higher platform inclining to the left; climb up and start walking left (avoiding the lava rocks) until you get to the leftmost point. Walk off the left edge of this platform; a cloud will rise, where you can get a 1-up and return to the platform above. Jump up to the above platform to your right and proceed until you see an automatically vanishing cloud with a gap under it. Fall down this gap and proceed to the right; you should hear a chime and a cage will have appeared through the wall to your left. You’ll then have to climb back up, go back to the bottom of the hill, then walk downhill to the right until you see a vertically moving spiky ball with a cloud near it. Climb on this cloud, then up onto the platform to the right; you’ll then see the fourth cage to the upper right on a platform.

- Go back to the left and climb back up to where you just were. Proceed further right, and climb up to the above platform. Proceed to the left, passing the photographer. You’ll reach some clouds; use them to reach the above platforms, then proceed to the right, ignoring the arrow of Tings for now. You’ll need to climb to the platform above, crawl through the space, then fall on the little ledge to the right; you’ll then hear a chime. Climb back up and crawl back to the left where you’ll now see the fifth cage on the ledge. You’ll have to avoid a stone man as you fall back down, unless you prefer to drop down on the right instead.

- Proceed back to the left to those ledges and clouds. You’ll see an arrow of Tings pointing to the upper left; follow the direction of the arrow by using the bouncing cloud and hovering to hang on the upper-left ledge. Climb all the appearing clouds until you reach the platform above, then proceed right. You’ll see a gap; fall down here and you’ll hear a few chimes. Avoid getting hit by the 2 stone men and take out the one on the right so you can then climb back up using the clouds. You’ll find the sixth cage on the upper-right platform.

- Fall back down the gap, then proceed right and crawl through the space to complete the stage.
