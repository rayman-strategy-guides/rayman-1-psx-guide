## Allegro Presto

> **Note:** You may need the running ability to get the third cage. It’s possible without the ability depending on the player’s skill level. Newer players may have to revisit.

### Stage 1

- As you begin this stage, proceed to the right on a downhill slippery slope until you get to the rightmost point. You then go back to the left again on another downhill slope. As you reach the leftmost point, you’ll just about see a ledge in the top left corner. Jump to hang from this ledge, climb up and proceed right across 2 platforms. You’ll see the first cage at the rightmost point of the second platform.

- Climb back down to the left, then as you slide down the next slope to the right, you’ll see the second cage below the platform you’re sliding on. Slow down, then climb down and get this cage. Climb back up and go to the left, then crawl under the spikes to the leftmost point of the platform if you want to try pick up speed for the next cage without the running ability.

- After getting the second cage, you must continue heading right again. Eventually you will reach an arrow pointing up-right. It is at this point you must jump (this might take a few tries) up onto the high platform up above where the third cage sits. This will be easier to get with the running ability; however, it can still be reached without it.

  > **Note:** If you plan to get the third cage without the running ability, you’re best off getting it before the second one, as you will have already picked up speed from sliding.

### Stage 2

- As you proceed through this stage, you’ll pass the photographer and shortly afterwards, you’ll get to a yawning trumpet that will pull you towards it. When it pulls you to the left, you’ll notice the fourth cage above you on a platform. Walk up the little slope to the left of the cage so you can reach it, then turn right and either jump to punch it, or hang on the ledge to climb up and break it.

### Stage 3

- As you begin this stage, jump on the first bongo. You’ll hear a chime – go back to the left and jump on the ledge. The fifth cage is there.

- After reaching the checkpoint, you must advance to the right until you hear a chime, then go back to the left and climb the sprinklers that have appeared. Follow the path from there which leads above to reach the sixth cage.

- You can meet the Magician in this stage. Continue from the point where you broke the sixth cage.  Drop down from here and proceed further into the stage until you come to an area with a drum-like platform. You’ll see some clouds to your upper left.  Continue further right to the slippery platforms and collect the small trail of Tings; you should hear a chime. Go back to the left; you’ll see a bouncing drum, which will enable you to reach the clouds and get to the Magician. In this bonus level, you must collect 12 Tings in 25 seconds. The gimmick here will be sprinklers; you must collect the Tings that are around them in the area. While it’s not too difficult, the fact that they rotate can be confusing.

### Stage 4

> **Note:** This stage cannot be revisited after defeating Mr. Sax.

- There are no cages are in this stage, but Rayman must avoid the purple wrong notes until he reaches the end, where he meets Mr. Sax for the first time. He leaves shortly afterward, revealing the exit sign.

### Stage 5

> **Note:** This stage can only be visited once.

- Here, **Betilla the Fairy** appears and grants you the **Helicopter** ability, which you must use to reach the exit sign across the gap to the right.
