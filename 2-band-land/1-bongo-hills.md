## Bongo Hills

### Stage 1

- Go through the stage until you reach a drum-like platform, then drop down to the platform below. Go left and fall down the gap; then proceed  to the right until you reach the top of the slope. Ride left down the slope (duck or crawl under the platform while sliding to keep up your momentum) and jump to reach 3 Tings; you’ll hear a chime as clouds appear on your left. Ride the topmost cloud until you reach a ledge with five Tings. The first cage will then appear on the platform above.

### Stage 2

- Advance to the end of the stage, then jump over the exit sign. You’ll hear a chime; travel to the right, where a cloud has appeared. Ride this cloud all the way back to the right, and follow the path until you see the second cage next to a barrier of spiky balls.

### Stage 3

- In this stage, you will be riding **maracas rockets** upward to get to the exit. When you reach the second maraca, you must continue dropping down past the sprinklers, until you reach the third cage on the platform below. 

### Stage 4

- *(requires grappling fist ability – you’ll need to go to Moskito’s Nest if you haven’t been there already)*  
  Advance until you see a pink flying ring, then swing on it to reach the platform on your right. You’ll find the fourth cage on this platform.

- You can meet the Magician in this stage. When you see the pink flying ring that leads to the fourth cage, fall down to the left through a small gap under a platform containing an Antitoon. Crawl through the small space to find a dead-end path where you’ll find the Magician. In this bonus area, you must collect 13 Tings in 40 seconds. The gimmick here will be multiple sliding bars, so be careful not to slide too far as you climb the bars to collect the Tings.

### Stage 5

- Jump on the sprinkler and ride it to the photographer. Jump off the sprinkler to a platform on your left to reach a **blue flying elf**, which will shrink you. After following the path to the left, you will end up back at the start. Ride the sprinkler down until you reach a platform below on your left, then jump onto it. Skip the first cloud you see, then go through the small path to the left and ride the next cloud up to the fifth cage.

- At the the end of the stage, jump over the exit sign; then fall down the first gap to your right. Proceed to the left, where you’ll find the sixth cage at the end of the path.

### Stage 6

- There are no cages in this stage.
