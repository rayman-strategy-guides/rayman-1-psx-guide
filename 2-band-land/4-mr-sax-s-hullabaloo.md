# Band Land

## Mr. Sax’s Hullabaloo

> **Note:** The sixth cage requires the grappling fist ability – you’ll need to go to Moskito’s Nest if you haven’t been there already.

### Stage 1

- Follow the path. The first cage can be seen hiding under a slide platform.

- After continuing past the area with maracas, you will come across a section with a health boost. Walk past the area until you hear a chime, then return to the area to find the second cage there.

- The third cage can be found right after the photographer and then jumping high enough at the end. A sprinkler will then appear which will enable Rayman to reach the cage.

- After continuing down the path awhile, a second slidable path appears above the one you are sliding down. Jump on the higher path and slide to the end of this path, where clouds will appear. These clouds lead to the fourth cage.

- The fifth cage is on the path in plain sight, you can’t miss it.

- After you pass the cymbals, swing on the pink flying rings to reach the platform above, where you’ll find the sixth cage.

### Stage 2

> **Note:** This stage cannot be revisited after defeating Mr. Sax.

- No cages here, but you must run from Mr. Sax. Hit the **wrong notes** back at him when you can!

### Stage 3

> **Note:**	This stage can only be visited once.

- You must defeat **Mr. Sax** here. His attacks mainly consist of blowing out **wrong notes**. You need to hit him 12 times to defeat him. Here are the three kinds of wrong notes:

  - **Type 1 (wrong note):** He blows out singular wrong notes similar to the ones you have seen throughout Band Land when facing him, and these are the ones you have to hit back at him.

  - **Type 2 (fragmentation note):** He starts shooting these after being hit a few times. He will shoot this variety into the air, where they will explode into 8 invincible tiny notes. You must avoid these by ducking.

  - **Type 3 (explosive note):** When his health is low, he will start shooting these. He will shoot them at a lower trajectory than the others, which will hit the ground and explode on impact, leaving harmful debris behind that can hurt Rayman. Jump to avoid these.
