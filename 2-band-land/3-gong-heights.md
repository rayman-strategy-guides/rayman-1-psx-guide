## Gong Heights

### Stage 1

- Rayman must get on the bongos of the first monk, then jump on the cloud above. The first cage will appear on the left.

- After getting on the drums of the fifth monk, you must helicopter to the left. The second cage will be in plain sight.

- When you come to an area with a lot of Tings and bouncing clouds, descend to a cloud below, where youâ€™ll see the third cage.

- After you pass the first monk with crystal balls, reach the recorder platform and the fourth cage will drop down from the sky.

### Stage 2

- As you proceed to the right in this stage, there will be an invisible force. You must move quickly; otherwise, the force will cause instant death. The fifth cage can be found after the first trail of Tings. 

- The sixth cage is at the bottom of a slope, after you jump over the final green wrong note in this area.
