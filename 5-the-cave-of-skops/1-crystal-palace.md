# The Cave of Skops

## Crystal Palace

### Stage 1

- Follow the bottom path first until you reach a group of Tings resembling a question mark. Head back to the left and the first cage will be there.

- The second cage will appear on the other side of the ledge the photographer is on; you must reach the side of the ledge he is on for it to appear first, though.

- After the second cage, swing on the pink flying rings to the right until you reach a group of three Tings, then head back and you will see a platform with the third cage on it.

### Stage 2

- Advance through the stage while boarding the platforms, which move vertically, until you reach an area where five platforms fall as you step on them. Fall down the platform that has nothing on it and continue right. The fourth cage will be in sight.

- Continue onward until you reach a platform with a spiky ball surrounding it in a triangular path and a large health boost to the left. Run and helicopter to the left and youâ€™ll find platforms which lead to the fifth cage.

- Following the fifth cage, a cloud should have appeared. Take this cloud until you hear a chime, then head back and you will find another cloud. Ride this cloud until you reach a narrow area where you must duck. After this area fall down and you will find the sixth cage.

- You can find the Magician in this stage. Proceed all the way to the end of the stage where you ride a large platform going down. As the platform goes off screen, head to the left, not right, and the Magician will be there. In this bonus round, you must collect **11 Tings** in **35 seconds**. The gimmick here is flying rings, which must be used to collect all the Tings. Some of them are red, so you should be really quick to move on to the next ring.
