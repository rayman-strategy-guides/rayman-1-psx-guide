# The Cave of Skops

## Eat at Joe’s

### Stage 1

- Nothing notable happens except that **Joe the Extra-Terrestrial** will give you a **firefly** for the next stage.

### Stage 2

> **WARNING:** This stage is pitch black except for the firefly that surrounds Rayman’s fist, so it’s advised to be very cautious throughout this stage.

- The first and only cage in this stage can be found as you cross four small floating platforms over the water, three of which contain Antitoons. There will be a higher platform to the right of the fourth floating platform. After reaching the higher platform, turn left where you’ll find a cloud. Jump on that cloud and the cage will be above you to the upper right on a higher platform.

### Stage 3

- The second cage can be found in plain sight next to the photographer.

- Stand on the platform where you found the second cage, then follow the path of the pink flying rings on your left until you reach a bouncing cloud which will lead you to another platform above. Proceed left until you reach an area where you’ll see lots of clouds lined up horizontally. They will move right, so hold the run button and proceed left running along the clouds, where you’ll find a platform containing a 1-up. Fall below the clouds and the third cage will be at the end of the path to your left.

- At the end of the stage, you’ll find two Tings floating beside a treasure chest. The fourth cage will appear to your right once you collect these two Tings. Afterwards, proceed left to the exit.

### Stage 4

- There are no cages in this stage.

### Stage 5

- Ride the flying saucers. You’ll come to a part just after two pink flying rings where you need to hit a switch then quickly jump to the flying saucer to your right. You’ll then have to duck under the spikes and you’ll come to another flying saucer that will lead you to the left. Jump on this flying saucer and it will lead you to a 1-up. Afterwards, jump on the flying saucer which leads you back the way you came, then jump to the flying saucer above and onto the ledge beside it containing a group of three Tings. Collect them and the fifth cage will appear on clouds to your right.

### Stage 6

- With the diner lit up again, Joe will let Rayman cross the sea with his buoys. At some point, you will come across several orange spiky platforms with a large red P ball there. Pass them then when you hear a chime head back and the sixth cage will be sitting there.
