# The Cave of Skops

## Mr. Skops’ Stalactites

### Stage 1

- The first cage can be found right away by jumping as you start, with it appearing below the ledge you’re on.

- Head to the left of the ledge you’re on to make clouds appear right of the first cage. Follow the clouds until you reach the second cage on the lone platform.

- Continue heading forward and the third cage will be in plain sight above the photographer.

- Skip to the other ledge above the photographer and you will hear a chime. Head below and find pink flying rings that lead you to the fourth cage.

- From the photographer, continue swinging on the pink flying rings until you reach a platform that falls when you step on it. The fifth cage can then be seen below.

- Past the fifth cage there will be water, and a very shallow strip of land. Jump on it to make the sixth cage appear on the left.

### Stage 2

> **Note:** This stage cannot be revisited once you beat Mr. Skops.

- You will find **Mr. Skops** sleeping. Awaken him and he will attempt to attack you a few times, while at the same time causing one of the platforms you stand on to fall into the lava. After several moments of attacking he will retreat. Quickly follow him while avoiding the rising lava until you reach the exit sign.

### Stage 3

> **Note:** This stage can only be visited once.

- In this stage, you must fight **Mr. Skops**. He attacks using his claw or the energy balls he shoots from his tail. Unlike most bosses, you can’t hit him with your fist normally. The energy balls he fires though, can damage him and they are locked on to your fist, so use your fist to aim the energy balls back at him. You must hit Mr. Skops 8 times to defeat him.

Unless you have broken all 102 Electoon cages at this point, you will not be able to advance to the last stage. If you have missed cages in any of the previous stages, you will need to revisit them.
