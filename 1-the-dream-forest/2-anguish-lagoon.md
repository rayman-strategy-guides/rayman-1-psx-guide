# The Dream Forest

## Anguish Lagoon

> **Note:** While it’s technically possible to break the second cage without the grappling fist by jumping off the plum in mid-air, it would require a highly skilled player to do so. Therefore, we haven’t mentioned it in this guide.

> *You can only get five cages on your first visit.*

### Stage 1

- At the start of this stage, advance to the right. You’ll see a swinging plum; hit it and then use it to reach the platform directly above it. Jump off the left side of this platform and hit the plum hanging from the platform above; it will then land on the platform below. Knock that plum off the left side of the platform and follow it left, where you’ll see a mushroom tree platform further left with a trail of Tings on top. Use the plum to reach the top of this platform; as you walk to its leftmost point, you’ll hear a chime. The first cage will have appeared right in front of the exit sign where you began the stage.

- *(requires the grappling fist)*  
  Return to the platform above the swinging plum. Once again, you need to use the  hanging plum to your left – knock it down and jump on it. You’ll then see a flying ring; grab it and swing over to the left to get the second cage, which is on a platform directly above the mushroom tree. After breaking the cage, proceed to the right.

- Just after the plum, you’ll see a trail of Tings under the first nenuphar. Be ready to duck down – there’s a hunter who guards a cage!

- Drop down with the nenuphar and kill the hunter. The third cage is right in front of you.

- As you climb back up to those nenuphars, jump onto the platform to your left (avoid the hunter’s fire). The fourth cage is right in front of you.

- Advance further left and jump across to the nearby platform, then proceed past the nenuphar on your left. There’s another hunter guarding the fifth cage here.

### Stage 2

- You’ll have to fight **Bzzit** (a mosquito) in this stage. He attacks by either stinging you with his proboscis or by charging at you from either side. You can avoid letting him hit you by jumping over him as he charges at you. The easiest way to hit him is when he is preparing to sting you, but it’s also possible to punch him while he’s charging. It takes 5 hits in total to defeat him. Once defeated he collapses and starts crying, but then Rayman cheers him up and teams up with him for the next stage.

### Stage 3

- You’re riding a mosquito in this stage and can punch. As you advance to the right, the sixth cage will be on the lower level sitting on a platform.

- As you proceed further, there will be Antitoons flying around, which you can punch. You’ll also need to dodge a hunter’s fire before avoiding some spiky fruit.

- As you approach the end of this stage, the mosquito speeds up. You will have to avoid the spiky fruit then he’ll accelerate even more. Shortly afterwards you’ll arrive at the exit sign.

### Stage 4

> **Note:** This stage can only be visited once.

- This will be your second encounter with **Betilla the Fairy**. In this stage, she grants you **the ability to hang from ledges**.

- Same as the first time except at the end you’ll have to use your new hanging ability to reach the exit sign instead.
