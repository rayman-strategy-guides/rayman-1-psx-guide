# Moskito’s Nest

> **Note:** You can only get five cages on your first visit.

## Stage 1

- As you begin this stage, walk left and jump over the exit sign. Jump on the mushroom tree platform using the hanging ability and then on the next mushroom tree. Collect the Tings; you’ll hear a chime and the first cage will appear just to the right of the exit sign.

- Knock the plum down and ride it while avoiding the spiky fruit. When you get to a platform with the photographer on it, stay on the plum and go under this platform. You’ll find the second cage on a ledge to the right.

- *(the following part requires the grappling fist ability)*  
  Climb up on the platform and as you pass the photographer, you’ll see a plum. Knock the plum down by punching it, jump on top of it and ride it down the hill until you see a vine to climb on. Jump and climb up this vine, then climb onto the platform to your left. Proceed to the left until you pass the Magician; a flying ring will appear as you get to the edge of the platform. Using the grappling fist to swing across the 3 flying rings on your left, you’ll find the third cage here, being guarded by a hunter.

- You can meet the Magician in this stage. Follow the steps to reach the third cage – the Magician can be seen before you reach the pink flying rings. In this bonus area, you must collect 17 Tings in 45 seconds. Once again, the gimmick here will be falling nenuphars; however, it’s much more risky this time, since you must climb to collect the Tings. Falling will waste valuable time and likely cause you to lose, so decide which platform to board carefully.

## Stage 2

- At the beginning of this part, walk left again. Hang on the mushroom tree platform and climb up, then walk further left and climb on the mushroom tree platform above. You’ll hear a chime; the fourth cage will appear to the right, which you’ll find upon climbing back down from the platforms.

- Advance to the right using the nenuphars; eventually, you’ll see the fifth cage just below a platform with the photographer on it.

- Advance further until you see the exit sign. You’ll see a hunter; kill him and knock the plum down which is directly above the exit sign. Avoid the exit sign and hit the plum to the left, making it fall in the water. Ride the plum to the right, under the platform where the exit sign is, to find the sixth cage.

## Stage 3

> **Note:** This stage can only be visited once.

- You will be chased by **Moskito**, who is holding a large purple spiky fruit, so you must reach the exit sign before him. There is also an invisible force which will kill you if you are not fast enough. 

- There are no cages here, so you simply have to reach the exit before Moskito.

## Stage 4

- There are no cages in this stage.

## Stage 5

> **Note:** This stage can only be visited once.

- In this stage, you must fight **Moskito**. To defeat him, you must hit him as he is charging or about to try to attack, much like the first mosquito. This time, however, you will have to avoid the spiky fruit as Moskito tries to hit you with it. The orange and red ones can be avoided by walking underneath them and the purple ones by ducking or crawling under them. You will have to hit Moskito 12 times to defeat him.

## Stage 6

> **Note:** This stage can only be visited once.

- You will meet Betilla the Fairy in this stage and receive the **grappling fist** ability from her.

- To exit the stage, swing on the pink flying rings above and get to the exit sign on the high ledge to the right.
