# The Swamps of Forgetfulness

## Stage 1

- You will receive a **magic seed** from **Tarayzan** after helping him, and must use this seed to escape the rising water throughout the stage.

- As you climb up, the first cage will be on the ledge after the lone hunter you encounter.

- The second cage is on the ledge directly above the first one.

- There’s a 1-up that can be found near the end of this stage. When you get to the exit sign, walk towards it. Just as you’re about to approach it, you should hear a chime and the 1-up will appear behind you.

## Stage 2

- Progress through the stage – eventually, you will see a nenuphar going back and forth. Knock down the plum to the left and ride it on the water under the nenuphar. The third cage will then appear on the platform to the right.

- Continue to the right and you will see another plum. Knock down this plum and ride it to the right and the fourth cage will be at the end, on the platform below the exit sign.

## Stage 3

- When you begin the stage, climb up the vine where the plum is, and follow the trail of Tings down to the left. You’ll hear a chime and the fifth cage will be waiting below.

- Knock down the plum and ride it until you see a nenuphar. Jump onto the nenuphar, then proceed right, following the higher path past the Magician until you reach the sixth cage.

- You can meet the Magician in this stage. Follow the steps to get to the sixth cage. The Magician will be on the first platform after the nenuphar, near a small trail of Tings which leads downward. In this bonus area, you must collect **12 Tings** within **30 seconds**. The gimmick of this area are swinging plums, and you have to climb to collect all the Tings. Some of the swinging plums may require you to hit with your fist.
