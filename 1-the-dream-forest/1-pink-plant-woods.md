# The Dream Forest

## Pink Plant Woods

> **Note:** You can only get three cages on your first visit.

### Stage 1

- There are no cages in this stage.
- This stage is fairly straightforward.
- Climb the vine just after the pink flower, then go towards the left by jumping from vine to vine. There’s a 1-up statue on the grassy platform.
- Here are a few hints to help you:
  - Collect as many Tings (sparkling blue spheres) as you can. Collecting 100 Tings gets you an extra life.
  - Collect simple/big health boosts (red “P” balls) to replenish life.
  - You will lose a life if you take too many hits or fall into water/the abyss.
  - In addition to losing a life, your ting count will also reset to 0.
  - If you lose all your lives, you can use a continue to keep playing.
  - You have 5 continues – if you use all of them and lose all your lives, your game is over!
  - When you meet the Magician, you can pay him 10 Tings to play a bonus level for extra lives, but you can only earn 1 life per bonus game once per save file.

### Stage 2

> **Note:** You can’t get any cages in this stage on your first visit, since you need the fist ability to destroy them.

- (requires the hanging ability): Advance to the right until you’ll see a ledge above that requires the hanging ability. The first cage is up here as you proceed further right, being guarded by a hunter. You will also find a 1-up next to it.
- (requires the hanging ability): This cage is a little further to the right from that point just past a nenuphar. You’ll need to stay on the upper level to reach it.
- (requires the fist ability): You’ll see a plum hanging from the bottom of a vine. Punch the plum so it falls in the water. Climb down onto the plum and ride it just past the vines to the right – the third cage is under the platform which contains the exit sign.
- You can meet the **Magician** in this stage. At the beginning of the stage, proceed left and take the flower spring to the vine hanging above. Climb the vine and the Magician’s hat will be on the platform to the right. You can also find a 1-up next to this vine. In this bonus level, you must collect 10 Tings in 25 seconds. The Tings surround several falling nenuphars, so you can start from either side.

### Stage 3

> **Note:** This stage can only be visited once.

- Get ready for your first encounter with **Betilla the Fairy**. You’re about to get the **fist ability** from her.
- Encounters with her are fairly straightforward – just walk forward and listen to what she has to say.
- When she finishes talking, walk forward, knock the plum down with your brand new fist, jump on it, and then jump towards the exit sign.

### Stage 4

- As you start the level, turn around and jump on the hand platform to reach the ledge above where a 1-up sits.
- You can’t miss this one, the fourth cage is right in front of you as the stage begins.
- As you advance further to the right you’ll see vines. The fifth cage is unmissable; you’ll see it on a platform to your right while climbing a vine as you advance further into the stage. Once you climb to the top of the vines you’ll see a 1-up to the left of the vines.
- The next cage is also unmissable and is again guarded by a hunter. Right before the exit sign, you’ll see the sixth cage.
- You can meet the Magician here. As you reach the end of the stage, look for a plum. Knock it down and into the water on the right. Ride the plum to the end of the stage; the Magician will be below the ledge containing a hunter and the exit sign. In this bonus level, you must collect 13 Tings in 35 seconds. No real gimmicks here, but the platforms are small; be careful and time your jumps wisely.
