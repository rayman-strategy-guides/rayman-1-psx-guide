# The Dream Forest

## Pink Plant Woods

> **Note:** You can only get three cages on your first visit.

### Stage 1

- There are no cages in this stage.
- This stage is fairly straightforward.
- Climb the vine just after the pink flower, then go towards the left by jumping from vine to vine. There’s a 1-up statue on the grassy platform.
- Here are a few hints to help you:
  - Collect as many Tings (sparkling blue spheres) as you can. Collecting 100 Tings gets you an extra life.
  - Collect simple/big health boosts (red “P” balls) to replenish life.
  - You will lose a life if you take too many hits or fall into water/the abyss.
  - In addition to losing a life, your ting count will also reset to 0.
  - If you lose all your lives, you can use a continue to keep playing.
  - You have 5 continues – if you use all of them and lose all your lives, your game is over!
  - When you meet the Magician, you can pay him 10 Tings to play a bonus level for extra lives, but you can only earn 1 life per bonus game once per save file.
